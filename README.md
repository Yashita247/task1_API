# task1_API

Assuming that the values have been entered in test_val.py:

A) SignupFlow:
  i. choosePlan.py
  ii.chooseSpecificPlan.py
  iii. setDomain.py
  iv.payment.py
Query: I could retrieve the required parameters from the respective API calls in payment.py, but I was not able to view the expected billing informating page in "payment.html" - attached to this repository. 

B) LoginFlow:
  i. loginPage.py
 Query: I could retrieve the values from test_val.py, but this page was showing a blank html "response", while others had a JSON format as response. Where should this call redirect to?
